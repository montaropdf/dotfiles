[1mNAME[0m
       git-clean - Remove untracked files from the working tree

[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
       [4mgit[24m [4mclean[24m [-d] [-f] [-i] [-n] [-q] [-e <pattern>] [-x | -X] [--] <path>...

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       Cleans the working tree by recursively removing files that are not under version control, starting from the current directory.

       Normally, only files unknown to Git are removed, but if the [1m-x [22moption is specified, ignored files are also removed. This can, for example, be useful to remove
       all build products.

       If any optional [1m<path>... [22marguments are given, only those paths are affected.

[1mOPTIONS[0m
       -d
           Normally, when no <path> is specified, git clean will not recurse into untracked directories to avoid removing too much. Specify -d to have it recurse
           into such directories as well. If any paths are specified, -d is irrelevant; all untracked files matching the specified paths (with exceptions for nested
           git directories mentioned under [1m--force[22m) will be removed.

       -f, --force
           If the Git configuration variable clean.requireForce is not set to false, [4mgit[24m [4mclean[24m will refuse to delete files or directories unless given -f or -i. Git
           will refuse to modify untracked nested git repositories (directories with a .git subdirectory) unless a second -f is given.

       -i, --interactive
           Show what would be done and clean files interactively. See ‚ÄúInteractive mode‚Äù for details.

       -n, --dry-run
           Don‚Äôt actually remove anything, just show what would be done.

       -q, --quiet
           Be quiet, only report errors, but not the files that are successfully removed.

       -e <pattern>, --exclude=<pattern>
           Use the given exclude pattern in addition to the standard ignore rules (see [1mgitignore[22m(5)).

       -x
           Don‚Äôt use the standard ignore rules (see [1mgitignore[22m(5)), but still use the ignore rules given with [1m-e [22moptions from the command line. This allows removing
           all untracked files, including build products. This can be used (possibly in conjunction with [4mgit[24m [4mrestore[24m or [4mgit[24m [4mreset[24m) to create a pristine working
           directory to test a clean build.

       -X
           Remove only files ignored by Git. This may be useful to rebuild everything from scratch, but keep manually created files.

[1mINTERACTIVE MODE[0m
       When the command enters the interactive mode, it shows the files and directories to be cleaned, and goes into its interactive command loop.

       The command loop shows the list of subcommands available, and gives a prompt "What now> ". In general, when the prompt ends with a single [4m>[24m, you can pick only
       one of the choices given and type return, like this:

               *** Commands ***
                   1: clean                2: filter by pattern    3: select by numbers
                   4: ask each             5: quit                 6: help
               What now> 1

       You also could say [1mc [22mor [1mclean [22mabove as long as the choice is unique.

       The main command loop has 6 subcommands.

       clean
           Start cleaning files and directories, and then quit.

       filter by pattern
           This shows the files and directories to be deleted and issues an "Input ignore patterns>>" prompt. You can input space-separated patterns to exclude files
           and directories from deletion. E.g. "*.c *.h" will excludes files end with ".c" and ".h" from deletion. When you are satisfied with the filtered result,
           press ENTER (empty) back to the main menu.

       select by numbers
           This shows the files and directories to be deleted and issues an "Select items to delete>>" prompt. When the prompt ends with double [4m>>[24m like this, you can
           make more than one selection, concatenated with whitespace or comma. Also you can say ranges. E.g. "2-5 7,9" to choose 2,3,4,5,7,9 from the list. If the
           second number in a range is omitted, all remaining items are selected. E.g. "7-" to choose 7,8,9 from the list. You can say [4m*[24m to choose everything. Also
           when you are satisfied with the filtered result, press ENTER (empty) back to the main menu.

       ask each
           This will start to clean, and you must confirm one by one in order to delete items. Please note that this action is not as efficient as the above two
           actions.

       quit
           This lets you quit without do cleaning.

       help
           Show brief usage of interactive git-clean.
